Remind that the original meaning of "**_significant_**" in the 19<sup>th</sup> century was **the obtained value shows something meaningful**


In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it became a new meaning as "**_very important_**".

???

1. P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a
specified statistical model.
2. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied
hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by
random chance alone.
3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be
based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.
4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.
5. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of
an effect or the importance of a result.
6. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of
evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.
